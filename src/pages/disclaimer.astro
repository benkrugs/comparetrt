      <h3>⚠️ Important Medical Disclaimer</h3>
      <p>CompareWeightMeds is an informational resource and comparison platform. We are not a medical provider, pharmacy, or healthcare institution. We do not prescribe medications, provide medical advice, diagnose conditions, or offer treatment recommendations.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Medical Disclaimer</h2>
    
    <h3>Not Medical Advice</h3>
    <p>All content on CompareWeightMeds.com (the "Site"), including but not limited to text, reviews, comparisons, scores, graphics, images, and other materials, is provided for informational and educational purposes only. This content is not intended to be, and should not be interpreted as, medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.</p>
    
    <h3>Consult Your Healthcare Provider</h3>
    <p>Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition, weight loss medication, or treatment plan. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something you read on this Site.</p>
    
    <h3>Emergency Medical Situations</h3>
    <p>If you think you may have a medical emergency, call your doctor, go to the emergency department, or call emergency services immediately. CompareWeightMeds does not recommend or endorse any specific tests, physicians, products, procedures, opinions, or other information that may be mentioned on the Site.</p>
    
    <h3>Individual Results May Vary</h3>
    <p>Weight loss results from GLP-1 medications (semaglutide, tirzepatide, liraglutide, etc.) vary significantly between individuals. Factors affecting results include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Starting weight and body composition</li>
      <li>Diet and exercise habits</li>
      <li>Genetic factors and metabolism</li>
      <li>Underlying medical conditions</li>
      <li>Medication dosage and adherence</li>
      <li>Duration of treatment</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The experiences of other patients do not guarantee your results will be similar.</p>
    
    <h2>Prescription Medication Information</h2>
    
    <h3>Prescription Required</h3>
    <p>GLP-1 medications including semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy), tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound), and liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza) are prescription medications that require evaluation and approval by a licensed healthcare provider. These medications are not appropriate for everyone and may have contraindications based on your medical history.</p>
    
    <h3>Side Effects and Risks</h3>
    <p>GLP-1 medications can cause side effects, some serious. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal pain. Serious risks may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)</li>
      <li>Gallbladder problems</li>
      <li>Kidney problems</li>
      <li>Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)</li>
      <li>Thyroid tumors (animal studies; risk in humans unknown)</li>
      <li>Allergic reactions</li>
      <li>Changes in vision (diabetic retinopathy complications)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Discuss all risks and benefits with your healthcare provider before starting treatment.</p>
    
    <h3>Compounded Medications</h3>
    <p>Some telehealth providers offer compounded versions of semaglutide and tirzepatide. Important facts about compounded medications:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Not FDA-Approved:</strong> Compounded medications are not approved by the FDA for safety, efficacy, or quality</li>
      <li><strong>Legally Manufactured:</strong> When sourced from licensed 503A or 503B compounding pharmacies, compounded medications are legal and regulated by state boards of pharmacy</li>
      <li><strong>Cost vs Quality Trade-off:</strong> Compounded medications typically cost 50-70% less than brand-name versions but lack FDA oversight</li>
      <li><strong>Same Active Ingredients:</strong> Compounded versions use the same active pharmaceutical ingredients (semaglutide or tirzepatide) as brand-name medications</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
    
    <h3>Compensation for Referrals</h3>
    <p>CompareWeightMeds participates in affiliate marketing programs. When you click on certain links to providers on our Site and subsequently sign up for their services, we may receive compensation in the form of commissions. This compensation comes at no additional cost to you.</p>
    
    <h3>Editorial Independence</h3>
    <p>Our affiliate relationships do not influence our reviews, scores, rankings, or editorial content. Providers cannot pay for better scores, higher rankings, or preferential treatment in our comparisons. Our proprietary TeleHealth Score methodology is applied consistently to all providers based on objective criteria, regardless of affiliate status.</p>
    
    <h3>Providers We Work With</h3>
    <p>We maintain affiliate relationships with several GLP-1 telehealth providers reviewed on this Site. We also review providers with whom we do not have affiliate relationships. The absence of an affiliate link does not indicate a negative review; it simply means we have not established a commercial relationship with that provider.</p>
    
    <h2>Accuracy of Information</h2>
    
    <h3>Best Efforts</h3>
    <p>We make every effort to ensure the information on this Site is accurate, current, and complete. However, pricing, policies, medication offerings, and other provider details change frequently. We update our reviews and comparisons regularly, but we cannot guarantee that all information is current at all times.</p>
    
    <h3>No Liability for Errors</h3>
    <p>We are not responsible for errors, omissions, or changes in provider information. Always verify pricing, policies, and medication details directly with the provider before making a decision.</p>
    
    <h3>Third-Party Content</h3>
    <p>This Site may include customer reviews, ratings from third-party platforms (e.g., Trustpilot, Better Business Bureau), and links to external websites. We do not control, endorse, or assume responsibility for third-party content. Inclusion of third-party content does not imply endorsement.</p>
    
    <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
    
    <h3>Use at Your Own Risk</h3>
    <p>Your use of this Site and reliance on any information provided is solely at your own risk. We expressly disclaim any liability for damages, losses, or adverse outcomes resulting from use of information found on this Site.</p>
    
    <h3>Do Your Own Research</h3>
    <p>This Site is a starting point for research, not an endpoint. Before choosing a GLP-1 telehealth provider or starting medication:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consult with your primary care physician</li>
      <li>Research provider credentials and reviews independently</li>
      <li>Verify pricing and policies directly with the provider</li>
      <li>Read all terms, conditions, and refund policies carefully</li>
      <li>Ask questions and request clarification when needed</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Privacy & Data Collection</h2>
    
    <h3>No Personal Health Information</h3>
    <p>We do not collect, store, or transmit personal health information. When you click affiliate links and sign up with providers, any health information you share is between you and that provider, subject to their privacy policies.</p>
    
    <h3>Website Analytics</h3>
    <p>We use standard website analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics) to understand how visitors use our Site. These tools may collect information such as your IP address, browser type, pages visited, and time spent on pages. This information is used in aggregate form to improve our Site and is not used to identify individual users.</p>
